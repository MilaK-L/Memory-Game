# Memory Game Project

## About

A web browser-based card matching game, done within Udacity Nanodegree course.
Live demo is [here](https://milak-l.github.io/Memory-Game/)

## How The Game Works

The game board consists of sixteen randomly arranged “cards” - eight different pairs - placed face down. Flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match! Game ends when all cards are revealed and matched. Have Fun!

### Known issues:
Animation when two open cards do not match doesn't work properly yet, and needs to be tweaked.
